# Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management trial FAQ

This topic answers your most frequently asked questions about the free product trial of Intelligent Order Management.

[!INCLUDE[trial-include](includes/trial-include.md)]

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes, you can purchase licenses through direct, credit card purchase at admin.microsoft.com. Or, you can work with sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [Pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/) for more information on pricing and purchasing.

To purchase the license using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for licenses.

After you have applied for the license to your tenant, you can publish your environment to production. You can remove the sample data. However, you have to manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you've added. We recommend that you create a fresh environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you’d like to move forward with.

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request for an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.
- The trial will expire if there’s no activity on the app for 14 consecutive days. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.
- You can have only one active trial per app at a time. You can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.

### How do I remove sample data from the trial?
