# Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management trial FAQ

This topic answers your most frequently asked questions about the free product trial of Intelligent Order Management.

[!INCLUDE[trial-include](includes/trial-include.md)]

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes. You can purchase a license using a credit card purchase by going to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home). Alternatively, you can work with Microsoft Sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [Pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/) for more information on pricing and purchasing.

To purchase a license using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for the license.

After you have applied for the license to your tenant, you can remove the sample data and publish your environment to production. However, you must manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you've added. We recommend that you create a new environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you’d like to move forward with.

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.
- The trial will expire if there’s no activity in the app for 14 consecutive days. Trials that have expired can't be reactivated, but you can start a new trial.
- You can have only one active trial per app at a time. You can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.

### How do I remove sample data from the trial?

Your trial environment has been curated to provide you with a fully functional application to ensure you can discover the business value of Intelligent Order Management right away. Sample data is provided so you can learn how the app works as if it were deployed to many users in your organization and with existing customer interactions. Because this is an actual environment, you can manually add or delete individual data records in your trial environment. There is no option to bulk delete the sample data and configurations from the trial environments.

### How do I restore sample data?

Sample data is provided with the trial environment and experience. To get a fresh dataset, you must wait for your trial to expire and start a new trial.
