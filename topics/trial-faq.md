# Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management trial FAQ

This article answers your most frequently asked questions about the free product trial of Intelligent Order Management.

[!INCLUDE[trial-include](includes/trial-include.md)]

## Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes. You can purchase a license by using a credit card purchase. Go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home). Alternatively, you can work with Microsoft Sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. For more information on pricing and purchasing, see the [Pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/).

To purchase a license by using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for the license.

After you apply for the license to your tenant, you can remove the sample data and publish your environment to production. However, you must manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you added. Create a new environment for your production environment and add the configurations you want to move forward with.

## What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that period, you can request an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.
- The trial expires if there's no activity in the app for 14 consecutive days. You can't reactivate expired trials, but you can start a new trial.
- You can have only one active trial per app at a time. You can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.

### How long does the trial last?

### How do I remove sample data from the trial?

The trial environment provides a fully functional application so you can discover the business value of Intelligent Order Management right away. Sample data helps you learn how the app works as if it were deployed to many users in your organization and with existing customer interactions. Because this is an actual environment, you can manually add or delete individual data records in your trial environment. There's no option to bulk delete the sample data and configurations from the trial environments.

### How do I restore sample data?

The trial environment and experience include sample data. To get a fresh dataset, you must wait for your trial to expire and start a new trial.
