[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Your organization will have access to Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management after you provision the app. To learn more, see [Deployment](deploy.md).

## Security concepts in Microsoft Dataverse

Intelligent Order Management is built as a Microsoft Dataverse app. You can manage security by using concepts such as business units, teams, and users. To learn more about security in Dataverse, see [Security concepts in Microsoft Dataverse](/power-platform/admin/wp-security-cds).

## Manage users

As an admin of Intelligent Order Management, you can add users to your environment through the admin capabilities of the platform. To learn more, see [Grant users access](/power-platform/admin/grant-users-access).

## Company concept in Dataverse

If you plan to implement Intelligent Order Management with a dual-write enabled app such as Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Commerce, or Dynamics 365 Finance, it's important to understand the concept of company in Dataverse and finance and operations apps. To learn more, see [Company concept in Dataverse](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/company-data).

## Dual-write overview

If you plan to implement Intelligent Order Management with finance and operations apps such as Supply Chain Management, Commerce, or Finance, you'll need to configure dual-write. To learn about dual-write, see [Dual-write overview](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview).
