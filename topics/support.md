To get support, you can submit questions to the [community site for Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management](https://community.dynamics.com/365/dynamics-365-intelligent-order-management). Microsoft is monitoring the community site. 

Customers and partners who are part of our private preview program can post questions on the Yammer group. 

If youâ€™re interested in providing input for our future releases, you can reach out to the team at <D365OMS@microsoft.com>.
