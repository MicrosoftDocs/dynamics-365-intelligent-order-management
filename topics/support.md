Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management is currently in the public preview release phase and is only available for development and evaluation purposes. 

To get support, you can submit questions to the [community site for Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management](https://community.dynamics.com/365/dynamics-365-intelligent-order-management). Microsoft is monitoring the community site during the preview phase. 

Customers and partners who are part of our private preview program can post questions on the Yammer group.
