For instructions on exporting your solution, see [Export solutions](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/export-solutions).

## Clean up after export

To clean up after export, follow these steps.

1. Go to the [Power App Maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com), navigate to **Solutions \> default solution**, and then filter on **Cloud flow**.
1. Stop the following cloud flows created to initialize provider definition logic definition. 
    - IOM Lab Order Intake Message Request Handler.
    - IOM Lab Send To Fulfillment (Outlook).
    - IOM Lab Send To Fulfillment (RequestBin).

> [!NOTE]
> New flows are generated when instantiating a provider. If these flows are not turned off, more than the expected outgoing payload will be sent.
