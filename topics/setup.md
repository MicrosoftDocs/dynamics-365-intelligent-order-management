## Create connections

To configure Intelligent Order Management, you first need to create a Dataverse connection, a Power Automate Management connection, and an Intelligent Order Management Data Transformer connection. 

1. Go to the [Power Automate portal](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/) and make sure you are in the correct Intelligent Order Management environment. To check which environment you are in, select **Environments** in the top-right corner of the Power Automate portal.
1. Go to **Data > Connections**.

### Create Dataverse connection

1. On the **Data > Connections** page, select **New connection**.
2. In the search box in the top-right corner, enter **Dataverse**.
3. Select **+** next to **Microsoft Dataverse**.

4. Select **Create**. When prompted to sign in, use the same credentials you used to sign in to Intelligent Order Management.

### Create Power Automate connection

1. On the **Data > Connections** page, select **New connection**.
2. In the search box in the top-right corner, enter **Power Automate Management**.
3. Select **+** next to **Power Automate Management**. When prompted to sign in, use the same credentials you used to sign in to Intelligent Order Management.

### Create IOM Data Transformer connection

1. On the **Data > Connections** page, select **New connection**.
2. In the search box in the top-right corner, enter **IOM Data Transformer**.
3. Select **+** next to **IOM Data Transformer**. When prompted to sign in, use the same credentials you used to sign in to Intelligent Order Management.

## Set up platform connection references

After you create your connections, you need to configure them.

1. Go to the **Welcome and get started** page in Intelligent Order Management.
2. Select **Configure settings**.
3. For each connection reference, do the following:
   1. Select the connection reference.
   1. To retrieve the connection URL, go to the [Power Automate portal](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/). Select the corresponding connection, and then copy the URL for the page. For example, if you are setting up the Intelligent Order Management Data Transformer connection reference, Select the **IOM Data Transformer** connection on the **Connections** page in Power Automate, and copy the URL from your browserâ€™s address bar.
   1. Go back to the corresponding connection reference page in Intelligent Order Management and paste the copied URL in the **Connection URL** field.

> [!NOTE]
> There are three platform Dataverse connection references. You can use the same Dataverse connection for all three. 

4. Once you've configured all of the platform connection references, select **Activate System** in Intelligent Order Management to turn on the related platform Power Automate flows. This may take a while.
