# Reporting and Power BI integration

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management provides insights for the business data moving through the system. These insights are critical for business users to monitor key metrics, respond to problems, and take actions to move orders through their business process.

Intelligent Order Management offers two types of dashboard technologies.

- Microsoft Unified Client Interface (UCI) dashboards: Use UCI dashboards to visualize app data stored in Microsoft Dataverse.

- Microsoft Power BI dashboards: Use Power BI dashboards to visualize app data stored in Dataverse or other data sources that Power BI can work with.

## UCI dashboards

Intelligent Order Management includes a dashboard called **Daily Events** that business users can use to monitor common data during a typical workday.

For more information about interactive dashboards, see [Create or edit model-driven app dashboards](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-dashboards).

## Power BI dashboards

Intelligent Order Management includes a dashboard called **Order Management** that's based on Power BI technology. This dashboard provides longer-range insights into the order and fulfillment data moving through the app.

For more information about building dashboards with Power BI, see the [Power BI documentation](/power-bi/).
