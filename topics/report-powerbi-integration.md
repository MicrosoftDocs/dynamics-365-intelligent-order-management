Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management provides insights for the business data moving through the system. The insights are critical for business users to monitor key metrics, respond to issues, and take actions to move orders through their business process.

There are two types of dashboard technologies available in Intelligent Order Management.

-   Microsoft Unified Client Interface (UCI) dashboards: UCI dashboards can be used to visualize app data stored in Microsoft Dataverse.

-   Microsoft Power BI dashboards: Power BI dashboards can be used to visualize app data stored in Dataverse or other data sources that Power BI can work with.

## UCI Dashboards

The preview release of Intelligent Order Management ships with a dashboard called **Daily Events** that can be used to monitor common data required by the business user in a typical workday.

To learn more about interactive dashboards, see [Create or edit model-driven app dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-dashboards).

## Power BI dashboards

The preview release of Intelligent Order Management ships with a dashboard called **Order Management** and is based on Power BI technology. This dashboard provides longer-range insights into the order and fulfillment data moving through the app.

To learn more about building dashboards with Power BI, see the [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).
