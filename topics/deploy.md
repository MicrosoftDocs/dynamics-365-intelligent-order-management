# Deployment

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]
[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management is currently in public preview, allowing customers and partners to evaluate and provide feedback. The app runs on the Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

## Deployment options

The preview release of Intelligent Order Management can be deployed as a trial in two ways.

-   Sign up for trial: Visit the [Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management marketing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/intelligent-order-management/) to step through the process of creating a trial system.

-   Power Platform Administration Center (PPAC): If you're an existing Microsoft Power Platform administrator, you can deploy a new environment for your organization for evaluation. To learn more about PPAC, see [Working with the admin portals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-work-with-admin-portals).

## System requirements

You can deploy the preview release through the trial experience which is provisioned and managed by Microsoft. As a customer or a partner, there are no systems prerequisites for using the trial experience.

## Local requirements

Intelligent Order Management is deployed in the Microsoft Azure data centers. Admins and business users access the app by using a web browser. There are no components that must be downloaded and configured on a user machine. Use a common web browser of your choice, such as Microsoft Edge. For more information about supported web browsers and hardware requirements, see [Web application requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/web-application-requirements).

## Service protection limits

Service protection limits exist to protect the health of the service. These limits provide a level of protection against random and unexpected surges in request volumes that threaten the availability and performance characteristics of the Microsoft Dataverse platform. Microsoft will publish guidance on the limits for Intelligent Order Management when the app is released for general availability. To learn more about this concept, see [Why choose Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/why-dataverse-overview)

## Capacity add-ons

Microsoft is managing the trial environments for customers to evaluate and provide feedback. More information will be available when the app is released for general availability. To learn more about this concept, see [Why choose Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/why-dataverse-overview)

## Backups

Trial environments are for evaluation and feedback purposes and come with demo data to support evaluations. Trial environments will be deleted after the 30-day trial period if you provision a trial environment and your environment isn't designated to be recovered after the 30-day trial period has ended.
