[!INCLUDE[banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article explains the user experience (UX) changes that were made to the sales order form in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management, based on the Microsoft fluent protocols. These changes simplify the workflow for creating, modifying, and viewing orders in Intelligent Order Management.

## Enable sales order form denormalization

To enable sales order form denormalization, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** \> **General Settings** \> **Feature version controls** \> **Manage**.
1. Select **Enhanced Pages Sales order KPI view**, and set the option to **On**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the feature, you change your view of the sales order form to the new view.

## Summary of changes

- The sales order form is reorganized into **Pricing**, **General**, **Billing**, **Shipping**, and **Delivery** sections.
- You can view the real-time inventory for order lines without having to switch pages. The number of taps or clicks that are required is also reduced.
- You can view order details and related fulfillments together with tracking on one page. No taps or clicks are required.
