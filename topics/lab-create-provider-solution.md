title: Create a new provider solution package

---

# Create a new provider solution package

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

It is recommended to have one provider per solution, but multiple providers can be included in the same solution. This is the solution that can be shared and will be installed on IOM environments.

# Create a new provider solution

1. Go to the [Power App Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and sign in with your IOM credentials. 
1. Go to **Solutions**.
1. Select **New solution**.
1. For **Display name**, enter "IOM LabProviders."
1. For **Name**, enter "IOM LabProviders."
1. For **Publisher**, select **CDS Default Publisher**.
1. For **Version**, enter "1.0.0.0."

Next step: [Create RequestBin custom connector](lab-create-requestbin-connector.md).
