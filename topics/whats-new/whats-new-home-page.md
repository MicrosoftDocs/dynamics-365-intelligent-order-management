<!--This template provides the basic structure of a home page for information about major and minor updates to the app that this docset is for. See [Write a What's new article](write-a-whats-new.md) in the BAP contributor guide. To provide feedback on this template contact [BAP Skilling feedback](mailto:templateswg@microsoft.com).-->

<!--H1. Required. Replace "this app" with product name as a general search in the article.-->

<!-- Introduction is standard phrasing, apart from app name and concrete links. Remember to update with the actual app name and link to release plans for that app -->

## Releases of Dynamics 365 Human Resources
<!--H2. Optional. Replace "Dynamics 365 Human Resources" with product name.-->
<!-- This section is optional, unless the app already has page either in docs or or support.microsoft.com or similar that list the bugs that are fixed for each version. Remember to update with the actual app name and link to where ever the relevant lists of what's in each update are published for that app. In this template, the HR app publishes these lists in the docs. That's not true for all apps. -->
Learn more about what's new or changed in recent releases in the links in the following table.

| Version | Build number | Auto-update availability | Learn more |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 10.0.32 |  10.0.1515   | March 2023    |[What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Human Resources 10.0.32 (March 2023)](get-started/hr-whats-new-changed-10-0-32.md)|

<!-- remove entries with an auto-update date older than the current month (unless the table is then pathetically short - there should always be three entries as a best practice). The links can be to articles in Docs, the planned-features article in the release plans, or KB articles with bug details. BAP Skilling does not own the individual articles with concrete information but provides tooling and guidance to help product teams, customer/partner success teams, or support teams gather relevant information.  -->

For earlier versions, see the archived release plans at [Release plans for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/release-plans/archived-plans).  <!--required section-->

## Get the latest version

New customers automatically get the latest version. If you're an existing partner/customer, check your email for notifications about updates. <!-- standard wording for apps with auto-update. If the app has an article with instruction for admins to apply an update, then link to that - for example: Learn more about how to get an update at [Process for moving to the latest update](../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-latest-update.md) or Learn more at [Manage updates in the admin center](../administration/tenant-admin-center-update-management.md).-->
