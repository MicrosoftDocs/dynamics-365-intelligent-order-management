# Set up Inventory Visibility provider

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up the Inventory Visibility provider in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management.

The Inventory Visibility provider add-in is a first-party, out-of-box service that's available as part of Intelligent Order Management. It's also known as the Inventory Visibility service. The Inventory Visibility provider enables real-time, on-hand inventory change postings and visibility tracking across all your data sources and channels.

For more information about the Inventory Visibility service, see [Inventory Visibility Add In](/dynamics365/supply-chain/inventory/inventory-visibility).

## Prerequisites

To use the Inventory Visibility provider in orchestration, you must first install the add-in, and then validate and update the following configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customer and want to use the Inventory Visibility add-in, see [Inventory Visibility tips](/dynamics365/supply-chain/inventory/inventory-visibility-tips).

To validate and update the Inventory Visibility add-in configurations, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Inventory Visibility \> Index And Reservations** in the site map.
1. Confirm that the following tabs appear on the page:

    - **Product Index Hierarchy**

    - **Set Calculated Measures** tab
    - **New Calculated Measure** button

1. Go to **Feature Management**, and enable the **OnHandReservation** feature.
1. Go to **Soft Reservation Hierarchy**, and confirm that the grid has the following elements:

    - **Dimensions** column
    - **Hierarchy** column
    - **Settings** button

1. Go to **Soft Reservation Mapping**, and confirm that the grid has the following elements:

    - **Physical Measure Data Source** column
    - **Physical Measure** column
    - **Available For Reservation Data Source** column

    - **Settings** button

1. Go to **Intelligent Order Management Mappings**, and confirm the grid has the following elements:

    - **Set Physical Measure Mapping** – This section includes the following columns. You can use it to map any of the physical measure mappings of your data source to a standard physical measure.

        - **Data Source** – This column refers to the source system.
        - **Base Measure** – This column refers to the Intelligent Order Management standard measure.
        - **Physical measure** – This column refers to the physical measure that's used in the source system.

    - **Set Calculated measure Mappings** – This section includes the following columns. You can use it to map any of the calculated measure mappings of your data source to a standard calculated measure.

        - **Data Source** – This column refers to the source system.
        - **Base Measure** – This column refers to the Intelligent Order Management standard measure.
        - **Calculated measure** – This column refers to the calculated measure that's used in the source system.

    - **Set Allocation Group Mappings** – This section includes the following columns. You can use it to map your defined allocation groups to a standard set of allocation groups.

        - **Allocation Group** – This column refers to a defined allocation group. The value can range from **group 0** through **group 7**.
        - **Allocation Group Name** – This column refers to the standard allocation group that your defined allocation group maps to.

> ![NOTE] 
> Currently, Intelligent Order Management supports allocation groups of up to two groups.

After you've completed the preceding validations and configuration updates, Intelligent Order Management configures or reuses the physical and calculated measures across all your data sources.

## Set up the provider

> [!NOTE]
> - The Inventory Visibility provider can be used to connect both to the inventory service that's available as part of Intelligent Order Management and to a Dynamics 365 Finance Inventory Visibility instance to soft reserve or update inventory upon shipment or receipt at returns.
> - The upload capability that uses Azure Blob Storage is exclusive to Intelligent Order Management and can only be used to upload an instance of the Intelligent Order Management Inventory service.

To set up the provider, follow these steps.

1. In Intelligent Order Management, go to **Providers \> Library**.
1. On the **Dynamics 365 Inventory Visibility** tile, select **Select**.
1. In the upper right, select **Activate Providers**.
1. On the **Terms and Conditions** page, select the checkbox, and then select **Accept**.
1. In the **Connections** section, you must set up two connections:

    - Inventory Visibility Blob Storage connection
    - Inventory Visibility Dataverse (current environment) connection

1. To set up the **Inventory Visibility Blob Storage** connection, follow these steps:

    1. Select the Inventory Visibility Blob Storage connection.
    1. Select **Create**. The Power Automate **Connections** page appears.
    1. Select **Add New Connection**.
    1. Search for **Azure Blob Storage**, and then select it.
    1. Select **Create**.

### Inventory Visibility JSON file example

The following JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) example shows what the contents of an uploaded Inventory Visibility JSON file look like. In this example, the **feedtype** value is set to **overwrite** for a one-time update. The value can also be set to **incremental** to add quantities to existing Inventory Visibility data.

```JSON
{
    "messagetype": "inventoryonhand",
    "feedtype": "overwrite",
    "source": "Flexe warehouse system",
    "customdimensions": false,
    "onhand": [
        {
            "productid": "prod301",
            "quantities": {
                "pos": {
                    "inbound": 25
                }
            }
        },
        "dimensions": {
            "locationid": "414"
        }
        {
            "productid": "prod302",
            "quantities": {
                "pos": {
                    "inbound": 50
                }
            }
        },
        "dimensions": {
            "locationid": "414"
        }
    ]
}
```
