title: Inventory Operations Visibility

---

Inventoy visibility is a key enablement of Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management that enables end to end visibility of inventory across your organizational units. Having full visibility enables preparation for the unexpected and helps make better business decisions.

Three primary benefits can be attained with a proper operational visibility:

1. Keep stock levels optimized.
2. Reduce Supply chain costs.
3. Improved decision making.

In order to give customers these benefits, we are introducing close to real time inventory query screens that can be used across different areas of Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management.

[!NOTE]
This query screen will be smart enough to understand if Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations is enabled in the landcsape. Accordingly this query screen will leverage Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations inventory for querying and showcase the availibility for the same.
In case Available to Promise is enabled, then this query screen will also allow to query incoming availibility from Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.
