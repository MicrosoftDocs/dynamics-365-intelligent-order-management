## Try Intelligent Order Management free for 30 days 

You can try Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management for 30 days through a simple sign-up process. The public preview trial version of Intelligent Order Management includes a “Getting started” guide that provides step-by-step instructions that allow you to view specific scenarios. Demo data is included for ease of use and to make the trial experience more realistic. 

A notification within the application will give you guidance on the time remaining in your public preview trial. After you finish your trial, you can sign up for another trial while the application is still in the public preview phase. Signing up for a new trial will enable you to experience additional features that will be released throughout the public preview phase. 

For more information about how to sign up for the public preview trial, see [Intelligent Order Management](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/eintelligent-order-management/).
